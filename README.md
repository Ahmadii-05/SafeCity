Title: SafeCity – Citizen Complaint & Public Service Tracker

Problem Statement:
A city’s municipal departments (roads, sanitation, water, electricity) receive thousands of citizen complaints daily through phone calls, emails, and walk-ins. However, the process is fragmented, manual, and lacks transparency. Citizens cannot track their complaints, many issues are delayed or unresolved, and supervisors struggle to monitor departmental efficiency.
To address this, the city government wants to implement a Salesforce-based Citizen Complaint & Public Service Tracker that will:

1.Automate complaint registration and routing to the correct department.

2.Allow citizens to track the status of their complaints in real time.

3.Enable escalation of unresolved issues.

4.Provide supervisors with dashboards to monitor complaint trends and departmental performance.

5.Collect feedback from citizens after complaint resolution.
